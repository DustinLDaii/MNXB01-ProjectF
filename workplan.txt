Each person writes report on their problem 


Edmund is release manager, everyone else on the team forks the project main and clones it to their local machine. 
Then one creates a change branch, works there, and when satisfied with work merges with local main, and creates
a pull request from local main to project main for Edmund to accept and/or comment on. 

# The distribution is workload is such:
-------------------------------------
-- Dustin will write a script which loads data from datasets and is in charge of the report structure 
-- Paulina does histogram of temperature of a given day 
-- Anton does mean of the day over all years throughout a year 
-- Edmund is release manager and will do covariance of temperatures between two cities
